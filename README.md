## LEMP Stack tutorial

### [Stack tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12cpMmUJecI-CJ8xCB3XXAeFqRcbnCBgimqDLBulxnuY/edit?usp=sharing)
We created a tutorial that details how to install a stack that consists of Linux, NginX, Sqlite, and Python. These applications together create a LEMP stack, which can be used for a slew of application hosting purposes. For our project, we used our LEMP stack to host a text-based game application, "A Dark Room",  which you will find links to below.
